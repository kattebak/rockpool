# Use the ADR Process

## Status

_accepted_

## Context

All software projects start with a set of foundational decisions. Instead of just _blindly following_ these decisions, we adopt a record of decisions to help us understand the motivations behind those decisions. This, in turn, empowers the future _us_ to understand and challenge those decisions when needed.

## Decision

- We adopt this process to keep track of decisions.
- We document the _why_ because it informs us of the _how_.
- One decision, one ADR. Keep decisions concise. Apply the process to high-impact decisions.
- The decisions affect the project. The project is the _context_. We store decisions alongside their _context_.
- For convenience, automation and tooling filenames follow the pattern **[number]-[title_under_scored].md**

## Consequences

- We create well documented decisions and drive alignment.
- ADRs are maintained inside the repository.
- Use pull requests to update and create ADRs.
